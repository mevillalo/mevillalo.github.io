# About
Hi! I am a Data Scientist with a Computer Science backgroud helping businesses solve real-world problems with data.

# Random things about me
- I believe in [The Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python), which you can read by doing
```python
import this
```
I  particularly think that **simple is better than complex**.
- I'm into the [Agile Manifesto and Principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html), specifically that **the user should be at the center** of everything you do.

# (Some) Projects
- **Sightwalk** explored the automatic generation of enjoyable walking paths from social media. It was the Capstone project for the MS in Data Science at NYU and won the award of _best project of the 2017 class_. It was done in collaboration with Felipe Ducau and Sebastian Brarda.

- **CWord** was an NLU/NLP with Deep Learning project incorporating larger context in neural conversation model, done in collaboration with Felipe Ducau in 2016.

- **Python Tracker** was the very first project in which I used Python for Data Science over 12 years ago. I helped [Elium](https://elium.com/) build their first analytics module to inform product development. I also analyzed their users by clustering them into profiles. The code is a thread-safe event logger used to store  the user's activity on their enterprise knowledge sharing platform.  [[source]](https://github.com/fducau/sightwalk)
