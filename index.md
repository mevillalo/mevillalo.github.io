# Random things about me
- I believe in [The Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python) which you can also ready by doing
```python
import this
```
- I'm into the [Agile Manifesto and Principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)
- [Python Tracker](https://github.com/mevillalo/python_tracker) was the very first project in which I used Python for Data Science over 12 years ago. I helped [Elium](https://elium.com/) (called Knowledge Plaza back then) build their first analytics module to drive product development and analyzed their users by clustering them into different types of usage groups. The code is a thread-save event logger used to store  the user's activity on their enterprise knowledge sharing platform.
